Robotic Setup / Equipment
=========================

Areas for parts, assembly and tools
There are *four* main areas within the robot's reach:

1. Clamp Rack
-----------------

Storage of all the clamps.
There maybe more than one type of clamps and more than one clamp per type.
This rack maybe vertically arranged to save space.

Example: The minimum test case has two 90deg clamps (only one type)

2. Gripper Rack
-----------------

Storage of one or more timber gripper for pick and place.
This rack maybe vertically arranged to save space.

Different grippers may have different amount or jaw/fingers and/or different spacing between them to accommodate different timber lengths.
This avoid excessive overhang of the timber element during transport.

3. Timber Stack
-----------------

Storage of multiple prefabricated timber elements.
Each element has a unique predetermined location in the stack.

Example: A vertically stacked pile of elements in accordance to assembly order. (Serial access only and planning in advance is crucial)

Example: A horizontally laid out set of elements in no particular order. (Random access possible)

4. Assembly Area
-----------------

Assembly area where the assembly action take place.

Foundation / temporary support may be provided for the structure to be assembled.

Scanning or feedback control system may observe this area.

# Mechatronics Design

Mechanical Design part of the project is mainly about the clamping tool used to assemble 

timber joints in a structure. The tool plays the following roles:

- Large assembly force in the direction of the assembly
- Alignment (Clamp to Timber / Timber to clamp)

- Synchronous (Position in Sync) between multiple clamps

The clamps need to have the following mechatronic features:

- Remote controlled (Wireless Radio Communication)
  - Clock Synchronization
  - Remote Command 
  - Remote Monitoring
- Battery Powered
- Spring loaded mechanism to clamp onto timber structure
- Linear actuator mechanism for main assembly force
- Alignment features between timber and clamp
- Robotic Quick Changer connection for robot to pick up
- Registration feature to align with clamp rack
  - Clamp Rack capable of charging

# Guidance Clamp

This passive clamp is designed to test the guidance feature that can be used for aligning lap joints.

The result of this test will be used for designing the lap clamp.

## Background

Precise alignment is necessary to assemble tight fitting joinery in architectural scale. Traditionally alignment is perform by manual workers on site, alignment features such as chamfer (knocking off the corners) are typical in traditional designs and provide guidance during the assembly process.

Guidance features allows more room for imprecision and reduce the precision needed for successful alignment. These guidance features can be cut integral into the joint geometry (such as chamfering a corner) or can be provided by an external device (Such as a scaffolding)

The goal is to determine if the

## Springs

**1.5x12x100 Stainless Steel Springs** were used in the first clamp prototype with success. It is a rather strong spring for improving clamping force (especially when the clamp is not positioned horizontally) however it also makes manual operation almost impossible.

It is possible to further test if weaker springs can be used if testing conditions allow.

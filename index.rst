.. Write project description

**Research project to investigate robotic assembly methods for timber structure with integral timber joints.**

The goal of this project is to answer two research questions:

- What are the robotic means to assemble timber structures with timber to timber joints?
- What new architectural possibility will this process enable?

These goals are achieved by developing new processes for automatic/robotic assembly of timber structures with timber joints.

- Process Design / Timber Joints Assembly by Robotic Clamps
- Process Design / Prefabricated Spatial Timber Structures
- Process Design / Timber Joint Detailing for Robotic Assembly
- Hardware / Robotic Clamps
- Hardware / Clamp Control Electronics
- Hardware / Robotic Grippers
- Software / Clamp Controller (C++ Arduino Firmware)
- Software / Radio Controller (C++ Arduino Firmware)
- Software / Radio Communication Library (Python Package)
- Software / Radio Communication Library (C++ Arduino Package)
- Software / Assembly Robot Control Server
- Software / Assembly Process Sequencer (Python)
- Software / Robotic Arm Path Planner (Python)
- Software / Timber Assembly Model (Python)
- Software / Structure Analysis Integraion

This repository is an incremental work (in progress) that contains code and documentation for these parts.

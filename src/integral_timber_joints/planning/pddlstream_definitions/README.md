## Assumptions for now
- all the retraction movements (approach/retraction) for linear motions are collapsed.

Remember that no negative predicate in preconditions!

## Basic discrete example

See the [discrete tamp](https://github.com/caelan/pddlstream/blob/master/examples/discrete_tamp/domain.pddl) example.

## Semantic Attachment

An example can be found [here](https://github.com/caelan/pddlstream/blob/master/examples/continuous_tamp/idtmp/run.py).
